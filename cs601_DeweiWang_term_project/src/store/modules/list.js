          <font size="3">David Pecker, once the publisher of one of America's largest tabloids, testified on the witness stand Tuesday about his history and relationship with former President Donald Trump and how he manipulated coverage of the 2016 election.<br>
          <br>
          Pecker is the former CEO of American Media Inc., which until 2019, was the publishing company of the National Enquirer magazine. He is now the first witness to testify against Donald Trump, the presumptive 2024 GOP presidential nominee, in a trial accusing the former president of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records with the intent to further other crimes. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Pecker's testimony resumed this morning after a short time on the stand on Monday and lasted until mid-afternoon when jurors were dismissed for the day. The trial is set to pick back up on Thursday morning.

          The prosecution's opening statements told the story of how they believe Pecker, Trump and Cohen conspired using a so-called "catch and kill" scheme in August of 2015 to bury negative stories that could be damaging to Trump's 2016 electoral prospects and promote articles in the tabloid that were negative about his opponents.<br>
          <br>
          Pecker also testified he specifically promised to look out for potentially damaging stories from women. Recalling that process, Pecker discussed how he found out about key stories — such as the claim of an affair with Playboy model Karen McDougal — and that he'd had a private conversation with Trump about purchasing the story to avoid it being published.<br>

          On Tuesday morning, just ahead of the second day of testimony, prosecutors asked Merchan to fine Trump $10,000 for violating a gag order and rule Trump in contempt of court for 10 posts made on Truth Social, Trump's social media platform, and his campaign website. Weeks before the trial began, Merchan issued a gag order on Trump that specifically bars him from making or directing others to make public statements about potential jurors, court staff or family members of staff.<br>

          I’m a novice reader. Dune is the first fiction book I’ve read for a very long time but, despite the plot being a bit hard to grasp at first, I really love the way it’s written.<br>
          <br>
          I’m excited to move onto more books with different authors, but I’m wondering if I should manage my expectations for the quality of writing. I know Dune is a very popular classic so I feel as though I may have started on a peak and should expect that there’ll likely be a dip in quality in the next novel I read. Is this misguided?<br>

          This might sound really silly, but anytime I’m surrounded in a book store or library or reading a book or even browsing this sub or Goodreads, I get this incredibly cozy and happy feeling. The prospect of discovering a new book I’ll love is thrilling, and the idea of falling into a story and reading the afternoon away with a cup of coffee or tea just makes me feel all warm and fuzzy. Anybody else?

          She loves to mine. She could spend hours walking through caves, mining up resources, placing them into chests never to look at them again. The only thing she uses her stacks of diamonds for is for more pickaxes when hers breaks. You should see our base. Dozens of chests full of stacks of iron, gold, even emeralds. All of the other parts of the game, building, fighting, going into other dimensions, none of that interests her. She even plays in peaceful mode so monsters don't scare her and disturb her mining. She mines so much I'm not even sure if she knows how to build. Sometimes I use spectator mode to follow her and watch from her perspective and it's almost mesmerizing watching her go. For me, I don't have the patience for mining. I love building things and using commands, so I spend most of the game in creative mode building crazy houses and firework cannons and using /fill to create giant cubes of TNT that destroy the ecosystem.<br>
          <br>
          I've become somewhat of a guardian angel for her. I give her shulker boxes so she can keep mining without having to return to the base. She hates the sound of sculks so I blow them up for her. Sometimes she forgets to bring wood for pickaxes so I /give her 6400 wood blocks. I'm not a very good angel since sometimes I'll spam summon bats when she's in a small cave, but I'm the best she's got.<br>
          <br>
          I just think it's very interesting how many different ways there are to play minecraft, and I wanted to see if anyone else relates to her.<br>

          Long story short, my brother likes DMZ but hates having people come out of nowhere and killing him. I love the PvP aspect, but I can only do so much when we have a full team on us.<br>
          <br>
          So yeah, is there a game like that that keeps the PvP out unless you knowingly enter the area, like The Division's Dark Zone?<br>
          <br>
          Editing for clarity: First person only, so no Division or the like. Semi realistic mechanics, no bullet sponge enemies, and you can die just as quick. Military or apocalyptic real world scenario, so no zombies or aliens. Resource gathering and quests to run, like EfT, with base building being an optional mechanic.<br>
